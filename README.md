# InfoVis 301: Climate Risk Visualizations

This repository contains the final project for InfoVis 301 – **Climate Risk Visualizations: A New Perspective on Urban Temperature Trends**. The project analyzes the [GlobalLandTemperaturesByMajorCity.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/code/antgoldbloom/exploring-climate-change-data/input?select=GlobalLandTemperaturesByMajorCity.csv) dataset from Kaggle using Python in a Jupyter/Google Colab notebook.

## How to Replicate

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NazirjonIsmoiljonov/infovis_301.git
   cd infovis_301
