# InfoVis 301: Climate Risk Visualizations

This repository contains the final project for InfoVis 301 – **Climate Risk Visualizations: A New Perspective on Urban Temperature Trends**. The project analyzes the [GlobalLandTemperaturesByMajorCity.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/code/antgoldbloom/exploring-climate-change-data/input?select=GlobalLandTemperaturesByMajorCity.csv) dataset from Kaggle using Python in a Jupyter/Google Colab notebook.

## How to Replicate

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NazirjonIsmoiljonov/infovis_301.git
   cd infovis_301

## Acknowledgments

This project was developed as part of **INFOSCI 301 – Data Visualization and Information Aesthetics** at Duke Kunshan University.  
Special thanks to Prof. Luyao Zhang for guidance; Prof. Binbin Li and Prof. Ming-Chun Huang for their valuable insights at the Digital Technology for Sustainability Symposium on April 18; Dongping Liu (Amazon QuickSight workshop) for hands-on dashboard training; David A. Schaaf (guest lecture on AR and Apple Vision Pro applications) for augmented-reality design guidance; and my classmates for their feedback.

## SDG Contribution

This work supports **SDG 13 – Climate Action** by providing an interactive framework for exploring urban temperature trends and risk projections, thereby enabling data-driven planning for climate resilience in cities.

Inspired by the heart‐and‐lung cast’s use of clear red/blue abstractions, future work will:
- Implement **discrete “heat bands”** in vector form (e.g., green/yellow/orange/red) to simplify temperature anomaly interpretation.  
- Add **view toggles** so users can switch between precise continuous maps and simplified banded views.  
- Conduct **community co-design sessions** to choose meaningful thresholds and color palettes that resonate with local audiences.
